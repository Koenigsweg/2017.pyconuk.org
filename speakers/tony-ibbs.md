name: Tony Ibbs

Also known as Tibs.

I've been using Python, on and off, since 1994, and now get paid to use it.

My CV is at http://tonyibbs.co.uk/, although it doesn't yet say I started work
at Arm in September.

I run the [Cambridge Python User Group](https://www.meetup.com/CamPUG) - we
meet the first Tuesday each month. You're welcome to come and join us.

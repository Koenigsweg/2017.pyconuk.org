The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a UK-based charity that works to put the power
of digital making into the hands of people all over the world, so they are
capable of understanding and shaping our increasingly digital world, able to
solve the problems that matter to them, and equipped for the jobs of the
future.

We provide low-cost, high-performance computers that people use to learn, solve
problems and have fun. We provide outreach and education to help more people
access computing and digital making. We develop free resources to help people
learn about computing and how to make things with computers, and train
educators who can guide other people to learn.

JPMorgan is one of the world’s biggest banks, and also one of the world’s biggest
technology companies. Globally we invest $9bn a year in technology and innovation.
In 14 technology hubs worldwide, our team of 40,000 technologists design, build
and deploy everything from enterprise technology initiatives to big data, machine
learning and mobile solutions, as well as innovations in electronic payments,
cybersecurity and cloud development.

In the UK, JPMorgan has 16,000 staff. The main technology centres are in London,
Bournemouth (4,000 staff) and Glasgow (1,500). Dublin is also expanding now to

Python is very widely used throughout the business. In the investment bank, much
of trading and risk management uses our Python platform called Athena.

Anvil is a platform for building full-stack web apps with nothing but Python.
With a visual UI designer, client- and server-side code in Python, and even a
pure-Python database API, we're here to make sure that anyone who can write
Python can build a web app with their favourite libraries and tools. From
data-science startups to devops over huge data centres, from oil and gas to the
insurance industry, Anvil is helping people build the tools they need. We're
excited to be sponsoring PyCon UK, and look forward to meeting you all in
Cardiff.

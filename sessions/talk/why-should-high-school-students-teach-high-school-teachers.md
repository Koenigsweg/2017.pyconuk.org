With the technology growing ever more complex, computing teachers sometimes struggle to keep up with the new trends and are often less versed than the students they are teaching. This can lead to frustration of both student and teacher, the former caused by discouraging lessons and the latter by a feeling of shame and inferior knowledge. How a about a different approach - what if the teacher made use of the exceptional students, requiring them to teach the rest of the class (as well as the teacher himself). As a fresh high school graduate I have first hand experience what it means to be bored at computing classes and how much more enjoyable can the lessons be made with just a little help from the students.

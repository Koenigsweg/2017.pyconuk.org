I am 15 year old that came to pyconuk last year and gave a lightening talk on how I made a micro:bit calculator that could then communicate with other micro:bits.

I have since broadened by learning to create the connect 4 game that I hinted at creating, and then combined it with google's neural net framework (tensorflow) and a raspberry pi to add an AI opponent.

I will be showing you what I learnt from developing my ideas, and how I overcame any issues I faced.

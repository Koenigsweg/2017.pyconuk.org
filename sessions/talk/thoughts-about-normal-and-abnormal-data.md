A lot of our data lives in databases. A lot of those databases are relational databases. They are called relational due to how objects refer to each other. But just because having references between certain records is “normal” and “what you should do” it doesn't mean it's the best choice. I will look into normalized and denormalized data and show what impact this can have.

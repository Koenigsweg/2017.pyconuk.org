The first direct detection of gravitational waves represented a major breakthrough in astronomy and astrophysics, with two more detections subsequently announced. Python software was used at all stages: from Laboratory testing and instrumental control, calibration, data mining and visualisation, to signal extraction. In this talk I will describe how python enabled these discoveries, and will outline how Python is crucial to further scientific discoveries with gravitational waves.

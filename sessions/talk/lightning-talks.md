### What are Lightning Talks?

A lightning talk is a short talk on any subject that the speaker thinks will be
of interest to the conference.

We run a session at the end of each day where the talks are a maximum of five
minutes' duration. At the end of five minutes,the microphone is cut and the
speaker has to leave the stage whether they've finished or not!

The sessions will be chaired to ensure that everything runs to time - normally
by asking the audience to begin clapping using two fingers from each hand when
the speaker has 20 seconds remaining.

Lightning talks are often entertaining and, for many, often the highlight of the
conference. If this is your first PyCon UK, it's a great way to start your
conference speaking career!

### Sounds Good. How do I Give a Lightning Talk?

At the registration desk each morning, you'll find two coloured buckets and a
set of index cards. If you would like to give a lightning talk that day:

* Take an index card
* Write on it your name and the title of your talk
* Drop it in the relevant bucket:
    * Green - if you've never spoken at a conference before
    * Yellow - everyone else

The buckets will close each day at 13:30 and, shortly afterwards, we will draw
cards at random (an equal number from each bucket) and post them on the
flipchart at reception.

You may submit as many proposals as you like but you may only give one lightning
talk at the conference in total. If we draw a speaker who has already given a
lightning talk, we will discard that card and draw another.

Successful speakers will need to confirm their talk with the registration desk
by 14:30. Any unconfirmed cards by that time will be removed and replacements
drawn from the buckets.

The buckets will be emptied each evening and start the day fresh and empty the
following morning. If you want to re-submit a proposal, you will need to
complete an index card and drop it in the bucket once again.

Good Luck!

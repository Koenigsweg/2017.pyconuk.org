During the last Antarctic summer we were part of the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition. We worked on board the Russian ice-strengthened ship, the Akademik Tryoshnikov, for three months supporting science teams from around the world investigating oceanography, atmospheric science, marine biology amongst other aspects of Antarctic science.

We will explain how Django helped us develop a database system and set of tools for the scientists and why it was so easy to build, even without prior Django experience.

This talk will be interesting to people new to Django to understand how it can be used, as well as those who are already familiar with it. Find out what we did, why Django was a very helpful tool (also when working offline!) and what changes we would make to Python and Django that would help on future expeditions.

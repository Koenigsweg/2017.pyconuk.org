        <h3>What are Lightning Talks?</h3>

<p>A lightning talk is a short talk on any subject that the speaker thinks will be
of interest to the conference.</p>

<p>We run a session at the end of each day where the talks are a maximum of five
minutes' duration. At the end of five minutes,the microphone is cut and the
speaker has to leave the stage whether they've finished or not!</p>

<p>The sessions will be chaired to ensure that everything runs to time - normally
by asking the audience to begin clapping using two fingers from each hand when
the speaker has 20 seconds remaining.</p>

<p>Lightning talks are often entertaining and, for many, often the highlight of the
conference. If this is your first PyCon UK, it's a great way to start your
conference speaking career!</p>

<h3>Sounds Good. How do I Give a Lightning Talk?</h3>

<p>At the registration desk each morning, you'll find two coloured buckets and a
set of index cards. If you would like to give a lightning talk that day:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take an index card</li>
<li>Write on it your name and the title of your talk</li>
<li>Drop it in the relevant bucket:
<ul>
<li>Green - if you've never spoken at a conference before</li>
<li>Yellow - everyone else</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The buckets will close each day at 13:30 and, shortly afterwards, we will draw
cards at random (an equal number from each bucket) and post them on the
flipchart at reception.</p>

<p>You may submit as many proposals as you like but you may only give one lightning
talk at the conference in total. If we draw a speaker who has already given a
lightning talk, we will discard that card and draw another.</p>

<p>Successful speakers will need to confirm their talk with the registration desk
by 14:30. Any unconfirmed cards by that time will be removed and replacements
drawn from the buckets.</p>

<p>The buckets will be emptied each evening and start the day fresh and empty the
following morning. If you want to re-submit a proposal, you will need to
complete an index card and drop it in the bucket once again.</p>

<p>Good Luck!</p>

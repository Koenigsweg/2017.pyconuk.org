Pandas is great for data analysis in Python. It promises intuitive DataFrames from R; speed like numpy; groupby like SQL. But there are plenty of pitfalls. This tutorial looks inside pandas to see how DataFrames actually work when building, indexing and grouping tables. You will learn how to write fast, efficient code, and how to scale up to bigger problems with libraries like Dask.

FoxDot is a Python library for interactive programming, specifically for live coding music. This talk will touch upon the history of live coding, the algorave movement (where people get together and dance to algorithms - yes, it's true), and how you can use Python to make your own music. The FoxDot editor gives users the ability to edit their Python code while it is being run, allowing them to enter a feedback loop where they can execute code, listen to the result, then change the code and re-execute it based on what they hear. Often dubbed "the composer programmer", a live coder makes the act of composing music a performance practice in itself. Python's clean syntax and flexibility lends itself to this and FoxDot allows users to define musical algorithms quickly and easily. The workshop will give you an overview of the musical possibilities of FoxDot and introduce you in depth to core constructs, providing you with the knowledge to continue to develop your live coding skills after the workshop has finished. FoxDot uses the audio synthesis engine, SuperCollider, which is required for the workshop - you can download it from http://supercollider.github.io. FoxDot is maintained at http://github.com/Qirky/FoxDot.

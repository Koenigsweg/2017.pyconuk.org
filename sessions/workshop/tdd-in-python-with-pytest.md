In this tutorial I will start a simple Python project from scratch and will develop it together with the attendees following a strict TDD methodology. The testing framework in use will be [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

During the tutorial we will use Python 3, but the concepts introduced are valid for Python 2 as well.

To properly enjoy the workshop you need **Python 3** (but Python 2 is fine) and **pytest** installed. Please refer to the documentation of your operating system of choice or search on Internet how to install the packages.

If you already have Python installed on your system, it should be enough to run

``` sh
pip install pytest
```

in a terminal.

Clone the [workshop repository](https://github.com/lgiordani/pytest_tutorial) as we will use it during the TDD session. If you properly installed the packages you should be able to run `py.test -svv` into the repository and see an output with one single test passing.

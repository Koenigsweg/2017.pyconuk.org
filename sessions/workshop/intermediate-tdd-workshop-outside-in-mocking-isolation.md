This session is aimed at an "intermediate" testing audience; labels like intermediate are always a bit dangerous, so to be more specific, I mean people who've learned a bit about testing, have tried it out a bit, and are starting to encounter some of the real-world problems of what to mock and what not to mock, and to wonder about best practices.

This workshop is based on a simple, practical example, where we'll go through a "pragmatic", non-mocky approach, and contrast it with a "purist", highly isolated approach, and see how it illustrates the strength and weaknesses of both approaches.  Hopefully we will conclude with a little discussion of how to get the best out of our tests, based on what it is we want from them.

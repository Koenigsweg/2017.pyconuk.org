We will be partnering with the TADPOLE challenge which is backed by Alzheimer's Research UK. The hack will comprise a "cut down" nevertheless fully valid version of a kaggle-style challenge which aims to use open data ( specifically, the ADNI datasets ) and machine learning to better diagnose this form of dementia.

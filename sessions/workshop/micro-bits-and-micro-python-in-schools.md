A practical workshop and discussion around using the BBC micro:bit and MicroPython with school and community groups. We work for an educational outreach charity, and have run workshops in primary and secondary schools, Big Bang Fairs, holiday and after-school clubs, and run regular Saturday clubs for 9-15 year olds. We will run through some lesson ideas, get you coding some micro:bits, and discuss our top tips for using micro:bits successfully with your groups.

We recommend installing Mu editor for this session, which can be found at: https://codewith.mu/

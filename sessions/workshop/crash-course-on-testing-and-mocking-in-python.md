This workshops focuses on the 20% most useful techniques and skills that give 80% of results. The goal is to be able to start testing your projects right after the training, rather than providing an overview of all available libraries, tools, development processes etc.

The workshop is targeted to intermediate programmers with little or no testing or mocking experience.

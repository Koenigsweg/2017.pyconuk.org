A one hour(ish), hands on session introducing teachers to the ideas behind processing and accessing Big Data through Python, specifically using Jupyter Notebooks and the Pandas Library. 

The concepts underlying Data Science are starting to make their way into both the GCSE and A Level exam specifications. This session aims to demystify how teachers can begin to bring practical sessions into their lessons around these ideas. Some prior knowledge of Python would be beneficial.

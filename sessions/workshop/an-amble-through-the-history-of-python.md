Python has been around since about 1991 (it depends on which version you talk about). I've been using it, in one way or another, nearly as long.

A lot has happened to the language and its users in that time, clearly too much to talk about in one session, so I hope to take you on an amble past some of the more interesting parts of Python's history.
The idea is to start at the beginning, and see how far we can get.

(When we did this talk at [CamPUG](https://www.meetup.com/CamPUG) I think we got up to Python 2.2.)

Note that this will be the sort of talk where people are welcome to interrupt and ask questions, join in, or even correct me if I've got something wrong(!).

The slides and their notes (with links) are available at

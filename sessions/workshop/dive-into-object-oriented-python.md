Each language has its own object-oriented implementation, that can differ in subtle or unexpected ways from others.

Newcomers to Python - whether they are coming from another language, or learning programming through Python for the first time - sometimes encounter some ‘strange’ issues, but understanding Python’s OOP implementation will help make many of them seem a lot less strange.

This tutorial will introduce beginners to Python’s beautiful but sometimes peculiar implementation of OOP concepts. It’s ideal for people who have a bit of Python knowledge and experience, and need to move from first steps to a deeper understanding.

You can find the source code I will use [in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/lgiordani/oopy) inside the `PyConUK2017/code` directory. The same source code is available as Jupyter Notebooks in the directory `PyConUK2017/notebooks`.

If you are an Ubuntu user you can run the `ubuntu_setup_notebook.sh` script to install a virtual environment with Jupyter, otherwise you have to look on Internet for the correct method.

Please bring **your own laptop**, as the workshop includes hands-on exercises. The minimum setup is **a running Python console** (preferably Python 3, but Python 2 is also OK) and **your editor of choice**. Running [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) is the preferred way to attend the workshop.

Slides for this workshop are available on [Speaker Deck](http://bit.ly/oopython).

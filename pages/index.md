PyCon UK is the annual gathering of the UK Python community and its friends from around the world.
This year, we return to [Cardiff City Hall](http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/),
from Thursday 26th to Monday 30th October.

The first four days of the conference will include talks and workshops,
while the fifth will be a day of sprints.

[Tickets are now on sale](/tickets/),
we're taking submissions for the [Call for Participation](/cfp/),
and applications are open for [financial assistance](/financial-assistance/).

Applications are also open for the [Django Girls](/django-girls/) workshop to
be held on the Thursday of the conference.

We're delighted that the [Education Track](/education/) returns,
in partnership with the Raspberry Pi Foundation,
and we look forward to welcoming teachers and children to the conference.

We're also working with [PyData London](http://london.pydata.org/) to put on a
[track of talks and workshops aimed at data scientists](/pydata/).

It's very important to us that all members of the community feel welcome and
comfortable at the conference.  [Read about our approach to diversity,
accessibilty, and inclusion](/diversity-accessibility-inclusion/).

We've got many more announcements to make over the coming weeks, so you should sign up to our mailing list.

PyCon UK is the annual gathering of the UK Python community and its friends from around the world.
This year, we return to [Cardiff City Hall](http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/),
from Thursday 26th to Monday 30th October.

**_Sold Out_**: we are completely sold out with over 700 people coming. We regret
that we have no waiting list. If you are a sponsor or a speaker with a query about
tickets please contact the [organising committee](/contact/)    .

We [still have tickets](https://hq.pyconuk.org/children/orders/new/) for the 
[Children's Day](/education/).

  The bar will be open from 6.30pm and dinner is served at 7.30pm.

### Communications

* The Front Desk will be staffed for Registration and general information
  throughout the conference. Please ask there if you need any help.
* During the conference the [PyCon UK Slack channel](https://pyconuk-2017.slack.com) 
  will be used to share announcements and other information
* You can also follow the [PyCon UK Twitter](https://twitter.com/pyconuk) 
  account for conference announcements
* For general queries please contact the [organising committee](/contact/)

### Food & Drink

* Coffee & pastries will be available before the start of the conference
  but if you want a proper breakfast you'd do well to explore Cardiff's
  cafe culture.
* The conference ticket includes lunch which will be available between 1pm and 2.30pm.
  Since we're feeding upwards of 700 people you will be offered a sitting between those times 
  when you register. It will help organise things if you can stick to that sitting
  but we're not doing retina scans at the start of the dinner queue!
* Coffee & Welsh Cakes will be available during the mid-morning and mid-afternoon
  breaks.
* There are two official conference Dinners, one for the whole conference,
  the other for Contributors (speakers, volunteers etc.). On other nights, or if 
  you have not booked for those dinners, people tend to self-organise into
  groups [perhaps using the Slack channel? TJG].

### Atmosphere

We very much want PyCon UK to be a welcoming event where everyone feels
comfortable. Please take the time to read about our approach to 
[Diversity, Accessibility and Inclusion](/diversity-accessibility-inclusion/).

We ask all those attending the conference to respect all other attendees
and to honour our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/).

### Parallel Tracks

PyCon UK is playing host to a number of parallel tracks. These will be
taking place on different days during the conference and we hope that
those attending will feel at home in the main conference.

title: The Education Track
---
Since 2011 we have welcomed teachers to PyCon UK's special education track
to promote programmer / teacher collaboration and mutual learning.
Since 2012 we have put on a kids' day where the proto-programmers of tomorrow
explore Python with the technologists of today.

We're doing it again this year,
on Saturday 28th October at Cardiff City Hall.

Teachers: come learn about Python,
its vibrant community and its uses in education;
"adopt a developer" and create new educational resources;
meet colleagues from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Micro:bit Foundation and Python Software Foundation;
and observe experts giving lessons to kids in the kids' day.

Kids (and parents): come learn how to build the future at PyCon UK.
Experts in computing education and professional programmers will be on hand
to deliver a series of fun, practical and interesting workshops
that'll help you learn the basics of programming,
develop your computing skills and make cool projects.

### Tickets

We'd love teachers to take part in the whole conference,
and so we are offering [heavily discounted tickets for teachers](/tickets/).
However, we understand the pressures that teachers face,
and tickets for teachers for the Education Track on the Saturday cost £18.
We are also offering [financial assistance](/financial-assistance/)
to help cover the cost of attending the conference.

Tickets for the kids' day will go on sale soon, and will cost £5.

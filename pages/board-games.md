title: Board Games Evening
---
- **Where**: Lower Hall
- **When**: Saturday 19:00 - 22:30

This year we'll be holding a board games evening on Saturday.

If you're a board games fan - please bring your favourite game and play with others! If you still think of board games as being a way of filling time at a family gathering, come along and find out what all the fuss is about!

There will be pizza for sale and a cash bar, and of course plenty of space for you to play games.

*For catering purposes, please let us know you're coming by [updating your profile](https://hq.pyconuk.org/profile/).*

We'll be on hand to help match people without a game to one they might enjoy - obviously we don't know what people will bring, but there's a huge range out there:

- Quick games
- Slow games
- Games which require no thought at all
- Games which require lots of thought
- One paragraph of rules
- Rule books the size of the Yellow Pages

For a flavour, take a look at what was [nominated for the prestigious Spiel Des Jahres award this year](https://arstechnica.co.uk/gaming/2017/05/game-of-the-year-spiel-des-jahres-nominees/), or fan site [Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/)

We look forward to seeing you there!

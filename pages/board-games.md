title: Board Games Evening
---

On Saturday evening in the Lower Hall 7pm onwards.

Please bring board games if you have them, we'll be on hand to help match
people to games if you don't.

Because we can't accommodate the entire conference, you'll be sent a link
to sign up via the PyCon UK booking site. The bar will be open and pizza
will be available to buy.

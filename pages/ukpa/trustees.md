title: Trustee Guidelines
---

### Overview

Trustees have control over, and legal responsibility for, a charity's management and administration. They are, in many ways, similar to Directors of a company or Governors of a school.

The main legal duties of a trustee are:

* To ensure that the charity is fulfilling its stated aims for the public benefit
* To ensure that the charity complies with its constitution and the law
* To act in the charity's best interests
* To manage the charity's resources responsibly
* To act with reasonable skill and care
* To ensure that the charity is accountable to its members

To be eligible as a trustee you must be at least 16 years of age and not otherwise disqualified under the Charities Act.

The Charity Commission provide further detail on the responsibilities of trustees and the circumstances which might lead to disqualification in their [Essential Trustee](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-essential-trustee-what-you-need-to-know-cc3) document.

### Standing for Election

At this year's conference, we will elect up to six trustees at the first AGM of the UKPA.

If you wish to stand for election, login to your account on the [conference management](https://hq.pyconuk.org/) site where, if you have purchased a ticket, you will find a link to submit your application.

The deadline for applications is 17:00, Friday September 29th 2017 (local UK time). Applications received after the deadline will not be accepted.

The AGM will be held on Saturday 28th October 2017 and the first meeting of the board of trustees will take place the following day. We ask that anyone standing for election as a UKPA trustee make themselves available for those two meetings. Precise times will be announced shortly.

title: Accommodation
---

Due to rumours of a heavyweight boxing match in Cardiff, as well as the other usual weekend attractions, hotel accommodation in the city has been snapped up much more quickly this year than usual.
If you're coming to PyCon UK, *book your accommodation now*. Don't delay any further. If you leave it too late, you may find that there is no more affordable accommodation available.
As well as the options and suggestions listed below, please use [our Wiki](http://pyconukaccommodation.wikia.com/wiki/PyConUKAccommodation_Wiki) to arrange sharing a room or rented house.

# Hotel booking sites

Check sites such as [Hotels.com](http://hotels.com) and [Booking.com](http://booking.com) for hotels. (Apparently
if you put your browser into private or incognito mode, you can sometimes get different, better, prices. Who knows?)

Not all hotels appear on booking sites, so also use general search engines.

Don't just search for hotels; also search for B&Bs: for example, on [Google Maps](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/search/B%26B+near+cardiff/@51.4671319,-3.2291182,12z/data=!4m5!2m4!5m3!5m2!1s2017-10-25!2i6).

# Hostels

There are a large number of [hostels](http://www.hostelworld.com/search?search_keywords=Cardiff%2C+Wales&country=Wales&city=Cardiff&date_from=2017-10-26&date_to=2017-10-29&number_of_guests=1)
in Cardiff that provide very cheap shared room accommodation for those "backpacking". If you don't mind sharing, this is perhaps the best value for money.

# Alternatives

There are hotels and guest-houses along Cathedral Road, a not unpleasant (this can depend upon what the weather
has to offer) walk away from City Hall through Bute Park.

Consult [Wimdu](http://www.wimdu.com/) and [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/).

# Get the location right

You'll have most fun at PyCon UK if you're staying somewhere a short walk from City Hall. Here's a [handy map of hotels in

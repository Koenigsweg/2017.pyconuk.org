title: Accommodation
---

After an unexploded WW2 bomb in 2015 and a Roald Dahl festival in 2016 this
year's unexpected PyCon UK mishap is the Anthony Joshua heavyweight boxing
match at Cardiff's Principality Stadium on the Saturday evening of the
conference (our busiest day).

Tens of thousands of people are expected to turn up to watch the fight.
Unfortunately it means accommodation will be very hard to come by over the
conference weekend.

However, all is not lost!  We have made reservations for around 200 beds in
dormitories in the following hostels:

 * [Mrs Potts Backpackers](http://www.mrspottsbackpackers.co.uk/)
 * [Bunkhouse Cardiff](http://www.bunkhousecardiff.co.uk/)
 * [Urdd Cardiff](http://www.urdd.cymru/en/residential-centres/cardiff/)

If you have a ticket for the conference, you can make a booking via the
[ticketing website](https://hq.pyconuk.org/accommodation/bookings/new/).

Other possibilities are listed below.

# Hotels, B&Bs, guesthouses

Check sites such as [Hotels.com](http://hotels.com) and [Booking.com](http://booking.com) for hotels.

Not all hotels appear on booking sites, so also use general search engines.

Don't just search for *hotels*; also search for *B&Bs*: for example, on [Google Maps](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/search/B%26B+near+cardiff/@51.4671319,-3.2291182,12z/data=!4m5!2m4!5m3!5m2!1s2017-10-25!2i6).

# Hostels

There are a large number of [hostels](http://www.hostelworld.com/search?search_keywords=Cardiff%2C+Wales&country=Wales&city=Cardiff&date_from=2017-10-26&date_to=2017-10-29&number_of_guests=1)
in Cardiff that provide very cheap shared room accommodation for those "backpacking". If you don't mind sharing, this is perhaps the best value for money.

# Rental houses and rooms

Consult [Wimdu](http://www.wimdu.com/) and [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/).

# Couchsurfing

Try a site such as [couchsurfing.com](https://www.couchsurfing.com) to find a spare room.

# Get the location right

You'll have most fun at PyCon UK if you're staying somewhere a short walk from City Hall. Here's a [handy map of hotels in

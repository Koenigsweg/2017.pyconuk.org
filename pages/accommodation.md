# Hotels

## Recommended partner hotels

The hotel listed in this section has given us preferential rates or terms or both. Their allocation of rooms for
PyCon UK attendees is likely to be exhausted well before the conference, so **you are strongly advised to book as early
as you can**.

Note that depending upon availability you may well be able to find cheaper rates than these, but on
less flexible terms (changes and cancellation not permitted).

Other hotels are listed after these.

Cardiff is a small city, and the weekend of PyCon UK will be busy. The longer you leave it to book your accommodation, the more difficult it will be to get it at a good price.

**Important**: if you find that the prices your are offered don't match the rates advertised below, that means that
they are simply no longer available. We don't have a contract with the hotel, and once the room allocations are gone,
they're gone.

#### Sleeperz Hotel

[Sleeperz Hotel](http://www.sleeperz.com) (tel +44 2920 478747); [email Sleeperz Hotel
reservations](mailto:reservations@sleeperzcardiff.com)) is a comfortable budget hotel, a minute's walk from the station and 15
minutes' walk from City Hall.

Please quote the *PYCON SELECT* rate when booking (phone or email). The negotiated PyCon UK rates include breakfast, in a
double or twin room.

## Use booking sites

Check sites such as [Hotels.com](http://hotels.com) and [Booking.com](http://booking.com) for other hotels. (Apparently
if you put your browser into private or incognito mode, you can sometimes get different, better, prices. Who knows?)

Some hotels donâ€™t even appear on those sites, never mind offer discounts to Pythonistas; you need to go to their
websites directly and pay the same as everyone else:

# Alternatives

There are hotels and guest-houses along Cathedral Road, a not unpleasant (this can depend upon what the weather
has to offer) walk away from City Hall through Bute Park.

Consult [Wimdu](http://www.wimdu.com/) and [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/).

# Get the location right

You'll have most fun at PyCon UK if you're staying somewhere a short walk from City Hall. Here's a [handy map of hotels in

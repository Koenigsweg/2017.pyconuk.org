Due to rumours of a heavyweight boxing match in Cardiff, as well as the other usual weekend attractions, hotel accommodation in the city has been snapped up much more quickly this year than usual.
If you're coming to PyCon UK, *book your accommodation now*. Don't delay any further. If you leave it too late, you may find that there is no more affordable accommodation available.

# Accommodation wiki

As well as the options and suggestions listed below, please use [our Wiki](http://pyconukaccommodation.wikia.com/wiki/PyConUKAccommodation_Wiki) to arrange sharing a room or rented house.

# Hotels, B&Bs, guesthouses

Check sites such as [Hotels.com](http://hotels.com) and [Booking.com](http://booking.com) for hotels.

Not all hotels appear on booking sites, so also use general search engines.

Don't just search for *hotels*; also search for *B&Bs*: for example, on [Google Maps](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/search/B%26B+near+cardiff/@51.4671319,-3.2291182,12z/data=!4m5!2m4!5m3!5m2!1s2017-10-25!2i6).

# Hostels

There are a large number of [hostels](http://www.hostelworld.com/search?search_keywords=Cardiff%2C+Wales&country=Wales&city=Cardiff&date_from=2017-10-26&date_to=2017-10-29&number_of_guests=1)
in Cardiff that provide very cheap shared room accommodation for those "backpacking". If you don't mind sharing, this is perhaps the best value for money.

# Rental houses and rooms

Consult [Wimdu](http://www.wimdu.com/) and [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/).

# Couchsurfing

Try a site such as [couchsurfing.com](https://www.couchsurfing.com) to find a spare room.

# Stay with a local Pythonista

If you're a Cardiff local and offer a spare room without charge to another conference attendee, we'll refund your conference
ticket. All you need to do is tell us at the event who your guest has been, and we'll refund the ticket.

If you have a suitable spare room, please [list it on the wiki](http://pyconukaccommodation.wikia.com/wiki/PyConUKAccommodation_Wiki).

# Get the location right

You'll have most fun at PyCon UK if you're staying somewhere a short walk from City Hall. Here's a [handy map of hotels in

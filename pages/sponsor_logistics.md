## The booth

Your booth should be staffed during the morning break (10:45&ndash;11:15), lunch (13:00&ndash;14:30), and in the afternoon break (16:00&ndash;16:30).
These will be the busiest times, but you might also like to have people around in between.

Each booth will have a 2x1m table, with space behind to sit, and space behind or to one side for banners.
Alternatively, you could send your own pop-up booth, but please let us know if itâ€™s going to be significantly larger than 2x1m.

**Booth attendees require their own tickets.**

If you want to send materials for your booth to City Hall ahead of the event, address them to

> PyCon UK
> City Hall Cardiff
> Cathays Park
> Cardiff CF10 3ND

We have access to the venue for setup from 6am on Thursday, and teardown finishes at 6pm on Monday.

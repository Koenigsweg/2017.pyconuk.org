Since the first Django Girls event in July 2014, thousands of women have been
introduced to Django and Python through these free workshops.

Their mission is to bring more amazing women into the world of technology and
increase the diversity of our community. They believe that technology is for
people and everyone should be able to build it. They make technology more
approachable by creating simple tools and resources designed with empathy.

Free conference tickets for PyCon UK will be given to DjangoGirls attendees.
These are full tickets, and include lunches, refreshments and everything else
that the conference has to offer.

The workshop will be oversubscribed; places will be allocated by the Django
Girls organisers.

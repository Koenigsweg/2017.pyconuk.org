title: Trans*Code
---

[Trans*Code](http://trans-code.org/) returns to PyCon UK for a day-long
hackathon to address issues facing the trans\* and nonbinary community.  The
day is open to all trans\* and nonbinary people and allies, and we welcome
participants from all skill levels and backgrounds.

The day will begin with participants suggesting apps and projects that are of
particular interest to the trans\* and nonbinary community.  We'll then
self-organize into teams, and spend the day working on our projects.

***

Entrance to the Trans\*Code hack day is included in the [conference
ticket](/tickets/).

However, if you are just coming to Cardiff for the hack day on Monday,

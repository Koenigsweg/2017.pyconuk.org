## What we need from sponsors

You'll need to send us:

*   The names and email addresses of the people claiming your free tickets
*   The name, email address, and phone number of somebody who'll be at the conference, and who can act as our point of contact

Additionally, we'll need:

*   A logo for the website (max 800×200, ideally in PNG)
*   A short description of your company for the website and conference booklet (you can get an idea of what other sponsors have written [on the sponsor page](/sponsors/))
*   A link to your website and/or Twitter handle

## Exhibiting at the conference

Sponsors can set up booths in the [Marble Hall](http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/rooms/marble-hall) from the Thursday to the Sunday of the conference.

You will be able to set up from 08:00 on Thursday, and we will keep the Marble Hall free from delegates until after the first keynote, around 10:30.

Your booth should be staffed during the morning break (11:00&ndash;11:30), lunch (13:00&ndash;14:30), and in the afternoon break (16:00&ndash;16:30).
These will be the busiest times, but you might also like to have people around in between.

Each booth will have a 2×1m table, with access to electrical power, space behind to sit, and space behind or to one side for banners.
Alternatively, you could send your own pop-up booth, but please let us know if it’s going to be significantly larger than 2×1m.

You will be able to set up your booth from 8am on Thursday.

Please note that booth attendees require their own tickets.

## Sending material to City Hall

If you want to send materials for your booth to City Hall ahead of the event, address them to

> PyCon UK <br/>
> City Hall Cardiff <br/>
> Cathays Park <br/>
> Cardiff CF10 3ND

We have access to the venue for setup from 6am on Thursday, and teardown finishes at 6pm on Monday.

## Jobs fair

The jobs fair will be held in the Marble Hall over the Sunday lunchtime, and will be a chance to meet with conference attendees who are (or expect to be soon) looking for work

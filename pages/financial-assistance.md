title: Financial Assistance
---

It is important to us that members of our community do not feel excluded from
the conference because they are unable to afford to come.  As such, we are able
to offer grants and subsidised tickets.

## Apply Now

To apply for financial assistance, please fill out and submit [this
form](https://hq.pyconuk.org/grants/applications/new/).  The deadline for
financial assistance applications is 23:59 BST on August 10th, and we'll be in
contact with you as soon as we can after then.

Please note that you *do not* need to have purchased a ticket before applying.

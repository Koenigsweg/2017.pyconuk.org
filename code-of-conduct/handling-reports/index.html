      <h2>Guidelines for responding to reports of harassment</h2>

<p>All committee members should read this document and be familiar with its
contents.</p>

<p>Be sure to have a good understanding of our <a href="/code-of-conduct/">Code of
Conduct</a>. Also have a good understanding of what is expected
from an attendee who reports a harassment incident. These guidelines can be
found <a href="/code-of-conduct/reporting-harassment/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>First steps on receiving a report</h3>

<p>Try to get as much of the incident in written form by the reporter. If you
cannot, transcribe it yourself as it was told to you. The important information
to gather includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>identifying information about the attendee doing the harassing;</li>
<li>the behavior that was in violation of the code of conduct;</li>
<li>the approximate time of the behavior;</li>
<li>the circumstances surrounding the incident;</li>
<li>other people involved in the incident.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prepare an initial response to the incident. This initial response is very
important. Depending on the details and severity of the incident, please follow
these guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>If there is any general threat to attendees or the safety of anyone is in
doubt, summon security or police.</li>
<li>Offer the victim a private place to sit.</li>
<li>Ask "is there a friend or trusted person who you would like to be with you?"
(if so, arrange for someone to fetch this person).</li>
<li>Ask them "how can I help?".</li>
<li>Provide them with your list of emergency contacts if they need help later.</li>
<li>If everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or security
only at a victim's request.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also some guidelines as to what not to do as an initial response:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not overtly invite them to withdraw the complaint or mention that
withdrawal is OK. This suggests that you want them to do so, and is therefore
coercive. "If you're OK with it [pursuing the complaint]" suggests that you
are by default pursuing it and is not coercive.</li>
<li>Do not ask for their advice on how to deal with the complaint. This is a staff
responsibility.</li>
<li>Do not offer them input into penalties. This is the committee's responsibility.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Handling a report</h3>

<p>Once something is reported to you as a committee member, immediately meet with
the conference chair and other committee members. The main objectives of this
meeting is to find out the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>What happened?</li>
<li>Are we doing anything about it?</li>
<li>Who is doing those things?</li>
<li>When are they doing them?</li>
</ul>

<p>After this meeting and discussion, have a committee member (preferably the
conference chair if available) communicate with the alleged harasser. Make sure
to inform them of what has been reported about them.</p>

<p>Allow the alleged harasser to give their side of the story to the staff. After
this point, if report stands, let them know what actions will be taken against
them.</p>

<p>Some options for the committee to consider when dealing with Code of Conduct
offenders:</p>

<ul>
<li>warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports
will result in sanctions;</li>
<li>requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical
proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event;</li>
<li>ending a talk early that violates the policy;</li>
<li>not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy;</li>
<li>not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at the
event now or in the future;</li>
<li>immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the
harasser holds;</li>
<li>requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future PyCon UK events (either
indefinitely or for a certain time period);</li>
<li>requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return;</li>
<li>banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain
time period);</li>
<li>publishing an account of the harassment and calling for the resignation of
the harasser from their responsibilities within the community.</li>
</ul>

<p>The way we deal with the incident publicly is very important. Our policy is to
make sure that everyone aware of the initial incident is also made aware that
official action has been taken, while still respecting the privacy of
individual attendees. When speaking about the incident to those who are aware
of it, but who were not involved with it, it is a good idea to keep the details
out.</p>

<p>Depending on the incident, the conference chair may decide to make one or more
public announcements. If necessary, this will be done with a short announcement
during a plenary session, or through other channels.  No one other than the
conference chair or someone delegated authority from the conference chair
should make any announcements.</p>
